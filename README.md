# Fashion-Design-Classification
In this Project First I have uploaded various datasets from Fashion MNIST using Keras. Performed various operations like Feature scalling, Build a Neural Network and trained itand then after Test & Evaluate the  Model. I have introduced Confusion Matrix to  define the performance of a Builded Neural Network. Finally shown the model classification report.
